# Text-classification-and-topic-modeling
Based on the dataset that consists of bank manager's replics and 1 of 4 topics is assigned to each replic for the train set I applied various ML algorithms to train modells and classify replics in the test set. I also created a function that classifies replics. In addition, I used LDA to perform topic modeling.
